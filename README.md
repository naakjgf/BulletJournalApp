## Emileigh56789: Your Personalized Planner & Organizer

**Stay organized, manage your time efficiently, and visualize your week at a glance with the new Emileigh56789 app. Designed using the powerful JavaFX GUI, this digital bullet journal provides a streamlined and intuitive interface, neatly displaying your tasks and events horizontally for each day of the week.**

### Key Features:

- **Week View:** Experience a digital rendition of your classic bullet journal spread. Name your week and view all seven days displayed in a clean, uncluttered interface.

- **Task & Event Creation:** Craft detailed tasks and events.

- **Persistence:** Save your progress anytime with our efficient .bujo file format. When you open the app, load your previously saved bullet journal data and carry on right from where you left off. Your work is never lost with the 'Save to File' and 'Open File' features.

- **Commitment Warnings:** Keep a check on your schedule's intensity. Set a limit to the number of events and tasks per day and get helpful warnings when you exceed these maximums. Your set limits will also be saved in your .bujo file.

- **Task Queue:** Feeling overwhelmed with your weekly commitments? View all your tasks for the week in a convenient sidebar, allowing you to manage your to-dos effectively.

- **Menu Bar & Shortcuts:** Access important commands directly from the menu bar or use handy shortcuts for actions like creating new tasks or events, saving your work, and more.

- **Mini Viewer:** Open a detailed view of any single event or task in a mini window.

- **Weekly Overview:** Get a quick snapshot of your weekly productivity. View total events and tasks, and see your task completion progress at a glance.

- **Takesie-backsies:** Made a mistake? Delete tasks and events with ease, and witness real-time updates in the GUI.

- **Mind Changes:** Keep your plans flexible with the ability to edit any aspect of your existing events or tasks right from the Week view.

- **Week Tabs:** Run multiple weeks simultaneously, each in a separate tab, and switch between them as you wish.

- **Deployable Application:** Just run the .jar file and launch your personal Emileigh56789.

- **Splash Screen:** Be greeted with a warm welcome screen every time you launch the application.

- **Privacy Lock:** Secure your bullet journal entries with military grade encryption using password protection.

- **Weekly Starters:** Use a .bujo file as a template for a new week. Your past events and tasks won't be carried over, but your other preferences will.
